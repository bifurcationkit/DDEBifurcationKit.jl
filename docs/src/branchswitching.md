## Branch switching from simple branch point to equilibria

You can perform automatic branch switching by calling `continuation` with the following options:

```julia
continuation(br::ContResult, ind_bif::Int, optionsCont::ContinuationPar; kwargs...)
```

where `br` is a branch computed after a call to `continuation` with detection of bifurcation points enabled. This call computes the branch bifurcating from the `ind_bif `th bifurcation point in `br`. An example of use is provided in [2d generalized Bratu–Gelfand problem](@ref).

> See [Branch switching (branch point)](@ref) precise method definition

### Simple example

```@example TUT1
using BifurcationKit, Plots

# vector field of transcritical bifurcation
F(x, p) = [x[1] * (p.μ - x[1])]

# parameters of the vector field
par = (μ = -0.2, )

# problem (automatic differentiation)
prob = BifurcationProblem(F, [0.1], par, (@optic _.μ); record_from_solution = (x, p; k...) -> x[1])

# compute branch of trivial equilibria (=0) and detect a bifurcation point
opts_br = ContinuationPar(dsmax = 0.05, ds = 0.01, detect_bifurcation = 3, nev = 2)
br = continuation(prob, PALC(), opts_br)
	
# perform branch switching on one side of the bifurcation point
br1Top = continuation(br, 1, ContinuationPar(opts_br; max_steps = 14) )

# on the other side
br1Bottom = continuation(br, 1, ContinuationPar(opts_br; ds = -opts_br.ds, max_steps = 14))

scene = plot(br, br1Top, br1Bottom; branchlabel = ["br", "br1Top", "br1Bottom"], legend = :topleft)
```

## Branch switching from non simple branch point to equilibria

We provide an automatic branch switching method in this case. The method is to first compute the reduced equation (see [Non-simple branch point](@ref)) and use it to compute the nearby solutions. These solutions are seeded as initial guess for [`continuation`](@ref). Hence, you can perform automatic branch switching by calling `continuation` with the following options:

```julia
continuation(br::ContResult, ind_bif::Int, optionsCont::ContinuationPar; kwargs...)
```

An example of use is provided in [2d generalized Bratu–Gelfand problem](@ref).

## Branch switching from Hopf point to periodic orbits

In order to compute the bifurcated branch of periodic solutions at a Hopf bifurcation point, you need to choose a method to compute periodic orbits among:

- [Periodic orbits based on orthogonal collocation](@ref)

Once you have decided which method to use, you use the following call:

```julia
continuation(br::ContResult, ind_HOPF::Int, _contParams::ContinuationPar,
	prob::AbstractPeriodicOrbitProblem ;
	δp = nothing, ampfactor = 1, kwargs...)
```

We refer to [`continuation`](@ref) for more information about the arguments. Here, we just say a few words about how we can specify `prob::AbstractPeriodicOrbitProblem`.

- For [Periodic orbits based on orthogonal collocation](@ref), you can pass `PeriodicOrbitOCollProblem(M, m)` where `M` is the number of times slices in the periodic orbit and `m` is the degree of the collocation polynomials.
