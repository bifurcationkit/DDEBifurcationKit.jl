# Periodic orbits based on orthogonal collocation

We compute `Ntst` time slices of a periodic orbit using orthogonal collocation. This is implemented in the structure `BifurcationKit.PeriodicOrbitOCollProblem`.

!!! warning "Large scale"
    The current implementation is not yet optimized for large scale problems. This will be improved in the future.

!!! warning "Floquet coefficients"
    The current implementation does not yet allow for computing stability of periodic orbits. This will be improved in the future.  

The general method is explained in [BifurcationKit.jl](https://bifurcationkit.github.io/BifurcationKitDocs.jl/stable/periodicOrbitCollocation/).
